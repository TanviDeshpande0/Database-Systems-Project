# Database-Systems-Project
<h2>Blood Drive Database System</h2>
<p>We chose to create a database system for blood drives because managing blood donations and distribution is a major challenge in the healthcare industry. Blood is a valuable resource that is frequently in limited supply and the process of matching blood types is very complex. The project goal is to provide a database system to track, manage and match blood donations according to patient needs. Through the implementation of a well designed database system for the Blood Drive, the project offers an effective solution for issues with blood type management, availability, and allocation.
